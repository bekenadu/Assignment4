        <h2>PsuedoClass</h2>
        <p>
            Is a selector  that selects elemnets, a tag under certian conditions of a certain state, like whe they are being hovered they tend to act as if
            you had applied a class to some part of your html file.
            We use this selectors to target part of an element that cant be targeted by using simple methods like class or id.
            we use PsuedoClass selectors to select elementd based on there attributes, state or even relative positions</p>
            <li>PsuedoClass are keyword that starts with a colol : </li>
            <li>: Psuedo-Class-name</li>
            <p><strong>For Example</strong></p>
             <li> input type="text" checked > br></li>
            <li>   input:checked {
                     margin : 32px;
                 }    
            </li>
            <li>now the second line will grow is margin only when the checked button is on</li>
            <li>so we apply PsuedoClass to tags that are under certian condiotion</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <h2>PsuedoElements</h2>
            <p>They behave in similar way but they act as if you had added a new html element.</p>
            <li>They start using double colon :: </li>
            <li>they dont apply on tags they apply inside the tags</li>
            <li><strong>For Example</strong></li>
            <li>P> This is a demo for PsuedoElements p></li>
            <li>p::before {content :"hey"}
            </li>
            <li>now the second line will add the content "hey" in our p tag in the begining</li>
            <li>p:: after { content: "hey"}
            </li>
            <li>this will add the content "hey" at the last of our p tag </li>
        </ul>
    <ul>
        <h2>Flex Layout</h2>
        <p>Flex layout is a layout thats in 1D in a ROW OR COLUMN</p>
        <P>Flex is a content based layout which means content first layout methods </P>
        <p>Before the Flexbox Layout module, there were four layout modes</p>
        
        <li>Block, for sections in a webpage</li>
        <li>Inline, for text</li>
        <li> for two-dimensional table data</li>
        <li>Positioned, for explicit position of an element</li>
        <p>The Flexible Box Layout Module, makes it easier to design flexible responsive layout structure without using float or
        positioning.</p> 
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <h2>Grid Layout</h2>
        <p>Grid Layout items are in 2D ROWS AND COLUMNS</p>
        <P>Grid Layout is a layout based system which means doing the layout comes first unlike the flex
        </P>
        <p>grid helps you to create the outer layout of a page so you can build a complex responsive design </p>
        <p>To make an HTML element behave as a grid container, you have to set the display property to grid or inline-grid.
        
        Grid containers consist of grid items, placed inside columns and rows.</p>
    </ul>
